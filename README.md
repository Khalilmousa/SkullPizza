# Skull Pizza
## Description
This is a website for a fictional pizza restaurant called “Skull Pizza” written in .NET CORE MVC. In creating this website my goal is to practice and cement my MVC knowledge, learn more about putting together the front end using the Bootstrap framework, and read and write data to a database from an MVC application.

Currently the site consists of a styled navigation bar and placeholder pages. Because this project will be reading and writing from a database, I have temporarily put updates on hold as of November 2022 while I learn about entity framework.

## Additional Features
As I continue to work on this site I will be adding:
- A menu page with each item displayed as a card with an image, size, and price
- The ability for users to add menu items to their cart
- The ability to create a custom pizza and have its price calculated automatically
- The ability to “check out” for delivery or pickup and have the order information written to a database
- Shopping cart functionality that automatically calculates the subtotal and total for the order
